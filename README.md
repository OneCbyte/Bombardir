**Bombardir** - this is a 2D game written in Python using the Pygame & Pygame_GUI library


**Bombardir** - this project was intended as training to develop my gameDev skills, but then it grew into something more. What you see is the second version of this project.
 

 ## Installation
 Install the correct version of [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) & [pygame_gui](https://pypi.org/project/pygame-gui/)

 ```bash
pip install pygame_gui -U
```

```bash

```

## Usage

You can use this project for learning purposes, sharpening your skills and practicing.

For installation:

### Warning 
The game may not launch or display an error related to ```pygame.mixer```. In most cases, this is due to the lack of audio output connections. Connect them and the problem will be solved.
