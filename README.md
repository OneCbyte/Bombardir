**Bombardir** - this is a 2D game written in Python using the Pygame & Pygame_GUI library


**Bombardir** - this project was intended as training to develop my gameDev skills, but then it grew into something more. What you see is the second version of this project.
 

 ## Installation
 Before installing, you must check that Python is installed on your machine. To find out, open a command prompt (if you have Windows) or a terminal (if you have MacOS or Linux) and type this:

```bash
python --version
```
 
 
If your version is 3.7 and above, then download the following packages from PyPI - [pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/) & [pygame_gui](https://pypi.org/project/pygame-gui/)

Or install them using the commands:

 ```bash
pip install pygame_gui -U
```

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

You can use this project for learning purposes, sharpening your skills and practicing.

For installation:
* Download the archive
* Place it in any place convenient for you
* Create a new project in Pycharm and copy all the folders and files from the archive into it and move it to your project
* Install the necessary libraries (```pygame & pygame_gui```)

Voila, everything is ready to launch : )

### Warning 
The game may not launch or display an error related to ```pygame.mixer```. In most cases, this is due to the lack of audio output connections. Connect them and the problem will be solved.
